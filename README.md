# PakTool

A tool for extracting and packing PopCap Pak files.


## Usage/Examples

```
paktool unpack main.pak folder
paktool pack folder main.pak
```


## Building

I'll write up a proper building method later, but this requires MSVC and CMake as the libpeggle library is intended to be used with an upcoming Haggle mod.
If you use CLion, this should be as simple as cloning the repository, opening the project in CLion, and hitting build.
If there is problems please let me know. (I think im going to add Premake support later).
